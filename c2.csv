"Thanks very much for this tutorial!  I augmented the code a bit to add a few more fields, along with a header...

  csvWrite = csv.writer(file)
  csvWrite.writerow([""publishedAt"",""authorDisplayName"",""likeCount"",""textDisplay""])
  for i in comments:
    row = [
      i[""snippet""][""topLevelComment""][""snippet""][""publishedAt""],
      i[""snippet""][""topLevelComment""][""snippet""][""authorDisplayName""],
      i[""snippet""][""topLevelComment""][""snippet""][""likeCount""],
      i[""snippet""][""topLevelComment""][""snippet""][""textDisplay""]
    ]
    csvWrite.writerow(row)"
